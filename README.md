# Restaurant Reservation System
An app to help restaurant workers manage reservations.

## Basic Structure

This repository is set up as a *monorepo*, meaning that the frontend and backend projects are in one repository. This allows you to open both projects in the same editor.

## Database setup

1. Set up four new ElephantSQL database instances - development, test, preview, and production by using .env file

### Knex

Run `npx knex` commands from within the `back-end` folder, which is where the `knexfile.js` file is located.

## Installation

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Run `cp ./back-end/.env.sample ./back-end/.env`.
1. Update the `./back-end/.env` file with the connection URL's to your ElephantSQL database instance.
1. Run `cp ./front-end/.env.sample ./front-end/.env`.
1. You should not need to make changes to the `./front-end/.env` file unless you want to connect to a backend at a location other than `http://localhost:5000`.
1. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:dev` to start your server in development mode.

## Running tests

This project has unit, integration, and end-to-end (e2e) tests. You have seen unit and integration tests in previous projects.
End-to-end tests use browser automation to interact with the application just like the user does.

Test are split up by user story. You can run the tests for a given user story by running:

`npm run test:X` where `X` is the user story number.

Have a look at the following examples:

- `npm run test:1` runs all the tests for user story 1 (both frontend and backend).
- `npm run test:3:backend` runs only the backend tests for user story 3.
- `npm run test:3:frontend` runs only the frontend tests for user story 3.


Once you have all user stories complete, you can run all the tests using the following commands:

- `npm test` runs _all_ tests.
- `npm run test:backend` runs _all_ backend tests.
- `npm run test:frontend` runs _all_ frontend tests.
- `npm run test:e2e` runs only the end-to-end tests.

If you would like a reminder of which npm scripts are available, run `npm run` to see a list of available commands.

Note that the logging level for the backend is set to `warn` when running tests and `info` otherwise.


### Frontend test timeout failure

Running the frontend tests on a resource constrained computer may result in timeout failures.

#### Screenshots

To help you better understand what might be happening during the end-to-end tests, screenshots are taken at various points in the test.

The screenshots are saved in `front-end/.screenshots` and you can review them after running the end-to-end tests.

You can use the screenshots to debug your code by rendering additional information on the screen.

## Projec Functions

#### Reservations

1. The `/reservations/new` page will
   - have the following required and not-nullable fields:
     - First name: `<input name="first_name" />`
     - Last name: `<input name="last_name" />`
     - Mobile number: `<input name="mobile_number" />`
     - Date of reservation: `<input name="reservation_date" />`
     - Time of reservation: `<input name="reservation_time" />`
     - Number of people in the party, which must be at least 1 person. `<input name="people" />`
   - display a `Submit` button that, when clicked, saves the new reservation, then displays the `/dashboard` page for the date of the new reservation
   - display a `Cancel` button that, when clicked, returns the user to the previous page
   - display any error messages returned from the API
1. The `/dashboard` page will
   - list all reservations for one date only. (E.g. if the URL is `/dashboard?date=2035-12-30` then send a GET to `/reservations?date=2035-12-30` to list the reservations for that date). The date is defaulted to today, and the reservations are sorted by time.
   - display next, previous, and today buttons that allow the user to see reservations on other dates
   - display any error messages returned from the API
1. The `/reservations` API will have the same validations as above and will return 400, along with an informative error message, when a validation error happens.
   - seed the reservations table with the data contained in `./back-end/src/db/seeds/00-reservations.json`


### Create reservation on a future, working date


1. The `/reservations/new` page will display an error message with `className="alert alert-danger"` if any of the following constraints are violated:
   - The reservation date is a Tuesday as the restaurant is closed on Tuesdays.
   - The reservation date is in the past. Only future reservations are allowed.
1. The `/reservations` API will have the same validations as above and will return 400, along with an informative error message, when a validation error happens.


### Create reservation within eligible timeframe

1. The `/reservations/new` page will display an error message with `className="alert alert-danger"`, if any of the following additional constraints are violated:
   - The reservation time is before 10:30 AM.
   - The reservation time is after 9:30 PM, because the restaurant closes at 10:30 PM and the customer needs to have time to enjoy their meal.
   - The reservation date and time combination is in the past. Only future reservations are allowed. E.g., if it is noon, only allow reservations starting _after_ noon today.
1. The `/reservations` API will have the same validations as above and will return 400, along with an informative error message, when a validation error happens.


### Seat reservation


1. The `/tables/new` page will
   - have the following required and not-nullable fields:
     - Table name: `<input name="table_name" />`, which must be at least 2 characters long.
     - Capacity: `<input name="capacity" />`, this is the number of people that can be seated at the table, which must be at least 1 person.
   - display a `Submit` button that, when clicked, saves the new table then displays the `/dashboard` page
   - display a `Cancel` button that, when clicked, returns the user to the previous page
1. The `/dashboard` page will:

   - display a list of all reservations in one area.
   - each reservation in the list will:
     - Display a "Seat" button on each reservation.
     - The "Seat" button must be a link with an `href` attribute that equals `/reservations/${reservation_id}/seat`, so it can be found by the tests.
   - display a list of all tables, sorted by `table_name`, in another area of the dashboard
     - Each table will display "Free" or "Occupied" depending on whether a reservation is seated at the table.
     - The "Free" or "Occupied" text must have a `data-table-id-status=${table.table_id}` attribute, so it can be found by the tests.

1. The `/reservations/:reservation_id/seat` page will
   - have the following required and not-nullable fields:
     - Table number: `<select name="table_id" />`. The text of each option must be `{table.table_name} - {table.capacity}` so the tests can find the options.
   - do not seat a reservation with more people than the capacity of the table
   - display a `Submit` button that, when clicked, assigns the table to the reservation then displays the `/dashboard` page
   - PUT to `/tables/:table_id/seat/` in order to save the table assignment. The body of the request must be `{ data: { reservation_id: x } }` where X is the reservation_id of the reservation being seated. The tests do not check the body returned by this request.
   - display a `Cancel` button that, when clicked, returns the user to the previous page
1. The `tables` table must be seeded with the following data:
   - `Bar #1` & `Bar #2`, each with a capacity of 1.
   - `#1` & `#2`, each with a capacity of 6.
1. The `/tables` API will have the same validations as above and will return 400, along with an informative error message, when a validation error happens.


### Finish an occupied table


1. The `/dashboard` page will
   - Display a "Finish" button on each _occupied_ table.
   - the "Finish" button must have a `data-table-id-finish={table.table_id}` attribute, so it can be found by the tests.
   - Clicking the "Finish" button will display the following confirmation: "Is this table ready to seat new guests? This cannot be undone." If the user selects "Ok" the system will: - Send a `DELETE` request to `/tables/:table_id/seat` in order to remove the table assignment. The tests do not check the body returned by this request. - The server should return 400 if the table is not occupied. - Refresh the list of tables to show that the table is now available.
   - Clicking the "Cancel" makes no changes.


### Reservation Status

1. The `/dashboard` page will
   - display the status of the reservation. The default status is "booked"
     - the status text must have a `data-reservation-id-status={reservation.reservation_id}` attribute, so it can be found by the tests.
   - display the Seat button only when the reservation status is "booked".
   - clicking the Seat button changes the status to "seated" and hides the Seat button.
   - clicking the Finish button associated with the table changes the reservation status to "finished" and removes the reservation from the dashboard.
   - to set the status, PUT to `/reservations/:reservation_id/status` with a body of `{data: { status: "<new-status>" } }` where `<new-status>` is one of booked, seated, or finished

### Search for a reservation by phone number

1. The `/search` page will
   - Display a search box `<input name="mobile_number" />` that displays the placeholder text: "Enter a customer's phone number"
   - Display a "Find" button next to the search box.
   - Clicking on the "Find" button will submit a request to the server (e.g. GET `/reservations?mobile_phone=555-1212`).
     - then the system will look for the reservation(s) in the database and display all matched records on the `/search` page using the same reservations list component as the `/dashboard` page.
     - the search page will display all reservations matching the phone number, regardless of status.
   - display `No reservations found` if there are no records found after clicking the Find button.

### Change an existing reservation

1. The `/dashboard` and the `/search` page will
   - Display an "Edit" button next to each reservation
     - Clicking the "Edit" button will navigate the user to the `/reservations/:reservation_id/edit` page
   - the "Edit" button must be a link with an `href` attribute that equals `/reservations/${reservation_id}/edit`, so it can be found by the tests.
   - Display a "Cancel" button next to each reservation
   - The Cancel button must have a `data-reservation-id-cancel={reservation.reservation_id}` attribute, so it can be found by the tests.
   - Clicking the "Cancel" button will display the following confirmation: "Do you want to cancel this reservation? This cannot be undone."
     - Clicking "Ok" on the confirmation dialog, sets the reservation status to `cancelled`, and the results on the page are refreshed.
       - set the status of the reservation to `cancelled` using a PUT to `/reservations/:reservation_id/status` with a body of `{data: { status: "cancelled" } }`.
     - Clicking "Cancel" on the confirmation dialog makes no changes.
1. The `/reservations/:reservation_id/edit` page will display the reservation form with the existing reservation data filled in
   - Only reservations with a status of "booked" can be edited.
   - Clicking the "Submit" button will save the reservation, then displays the previous page.
   - Clicking "Cancel" makes no changes, then display the previous page.
